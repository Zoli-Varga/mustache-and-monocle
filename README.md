# Mustache and monocle

This is one of my older projects, I made it a few years ago.
Using OpenCV2, a person's face can be detected. A mustache above their mouth and a monocle on their right eye appears which give the user a *19th century* gentleman style. **Example picture**:

As you can see, the program can detect my right eye despite I'm wearing glasses. Also, a mustache appears on my face - I can guarantee it's not my own.
It's **important** to note that the user shouldn't use the software in dark places as it may couldn't detect the person's face properly and the monocle and mustache may not appear.
